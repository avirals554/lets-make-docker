to under stand this there are a few stuff that you need to get first ( they are not hard )
what is a file system?
what are the different types of file system ?
why brtfs ?


  the answer are gonna be the most simple that i can make you under stand (my future self )

answer 1 && 2
what is a file system? and why do we need to understand them ? file system is basically "how " the os looks at file i know this might sound vague but that is probbly the best dexcription that works for me
there are several types of file systems namely -
ntfs file system (" for windows ")
dxt4 file system ("commonn in most linux distros ")
and btrfs ("a mordern version of the dxt4") and what we are gonna use in this to make this project
answer 3
what are some of the different advantages of the btrfs lets take a look -
snapshot feature -"think of it as like a git way of taking a snapshot of the file and then using it"
copy before write -" only monitors the changes in a file and then maps accirdingly "
creating sub volumes "ALWAYS REMEMBER THE REASON THEY ARE DIFFERENT FROM LIKE MKDIR IS BECAUSE WE CANNOT DO THE PREVIOUS STUFF ON A DIRECTORY THAT IS WHY WE NEED IT "



some of the common things to play with in btfs --
sudo btrfs filesystem df /var/bocker --
  checking the amount of space that is used and all the general data about the stuff { remember that i have done this in a /var folder that deals with constant cahnges stuff  and i have made this inside a docker
sudo btrfs subvolume snapshot /var/bocker/test /var/bocker/test_backup  ---
this is an example of how to take a snapshot of that file and store it



also you would need to mount it on the a file named /var/bocker we are doing this for stroing info about the images that we are gonna pull like /var/bocker/image


do these steps first
 mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/nvme0n1p4
sudo mkdir -p /var/bocker
sudo mount -t btrfs /dev/nvme0n1p4 /var/bocker
mount | grep /var/bocker
